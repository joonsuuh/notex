Big Ocean is a pioneering K-pop boy band from South Korea, notable for being the first idol group composed of members with hearing impairments. The trio—Park Hyun-jin, Lee Chan-yeon, and Kim Ji-seok—each have varying degrees of hearing loss. Park lost part of his hearing at age three, Lee at age eleven, and Kim was born with a hearing impairment. Despite these challenges, they have made significant strides in the music industry, promoting inclusivity and challenging societal norms.

Debuting on April 20, 2024, coinciding with Korea’s Day of People with Disabilities, Big Ocean has released multiple singles, including a remake of H.O.T.'s 1998 hit "Hope." as "Glow". Their performances are distinctive, incorporating Korean Sign Language (KSL), American Sign Language (ASL), and International Sign Language (ISL) into their choreography, making their music accessible to both hearing and non-hearing audiences.

To overcome the challenges posed by their hearing impairments, Big Ocean utilizes advanced technologies. During recordings, they receive assistance from artificial intelligence that learns each member's voice data to help mix their voices properly. Additionally, in live performances, they use smartwatches that vibrate to the beat of the music and monitors that flash lights every eight beats to help them stay in rhythm while dancing.

Big Ocean has also actively collaborated with established artists to promote inclusivity in the music industry. Notably, they partnered with SEVENTEEN members Seungkwan and DK for the "Glow" challenge on  [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@big_ocean.official/video/7368116224498093329), a social media initiative aimed at raising awareness and engagement. In the video, both Big Ocean and the members of SEVENTEEN choreograph their dance moves with sign language which is a very novel and rare thing to see in Korean pop culture. 

Through their music and performances, Big Ocean is fostering an open environment for disability and music in Korean society. By integrating sign language into their acts and leveraging technology to enhance their performances, they challenge traditional perceptions of disability, inspiring both the music industry and audiences to embrace inclusivity and diversity.

# Something Comforting - Porter Robinson

![something comforting - porter robinson youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGrhyOtikQ0)

Porter Robinson’s _Nurture_ album takes the listener on a journey of emotional vulnerability and his reconnection to music after a 7 year writer's block being unable to create an album after his studio debut in 2014 with *Worlds*. The track “Something Comforting,” explores themes of vulnerability, human imperfection, and resilience, resonating deeply with disability perspectives. Central to this exploration is his use of vocaloid technology—a synthetic voice manipulation tool. By altering his vocals to sound fragmented, high-pitched, and "unnatural," Robinson intentionally eschews traditional notions of vocal perfection. This technique evokes the struggle of self-expression and a voice shaped by limitations therefore performing a disabled voice. 

In “Something Comforting,” the vocaloid voice becomes Porters disabled voice. The song’s lyrics narrate how there is "something wrong with me" hinting at some sort of inferiority Porter has placed onto himself. Porter, then repeatedly asks the audience to tell him "something comforting" as a cry for help. As an electronic music producer/DJ, Porter Robinson's disability was his inability to incorporate his own voice into a genre that focuses on pristine vocals from a collaborating artist and high energy, upbeat, drops that conducts music for clubs and dance festivals. Robinson subverts this by using his voice as an imperfect, expressive instrument. On _Nurture_, his vocals are often layered with vocaloid effects or pitch modulation, emphasizing fragility and humanity rather than perfection. Furthermore, he finally introduces his actual voice through a mix of call and response by the end of the song. This supplants that the vocaloid voice is a part of Robinson's voice, and both his voice and the vocaloid voice are imperfect yet a source of his identity and humanity. 

Robinson has spoken about his creative block and feelings of inadequacy preceding _Nurture_, framing the album as a return to self-acceptance. This journey mirrors disability frameworks of reframing limitations as sources of strength and creativity. The vocaloid's altered tone becomes a symbol of this process, challenging the listener to find beauty in imperfection and distorted forms of expression.

Through these artistic choices, Porter Robinson performs disability—as a sort of identity to explore resilience, transformation, and the profound relationship between human flaws and art. The result is a deeply empathetic body of work that validates imperfection as integral to authenticity and connection.

# Trans Riot Music - Free.99

In _Trans Riot Music_ by Free.99, the use of industrial and glitch sounds that overpower the vocals can be interpreted as a sonic representation of the marginalization and systemic barriers faced by trans individuals, particularly those with disabilities. The industrial sounds evoke an oppressive and mechanized world, reflecting the societal structures that often alienate and dehumanize marginalized groups. These overwhelming sonic textures mirror the noise and chaos trans people with disabilities navigate daily—both in the form of societal discrimination and the internalized struggles born of systemic neglect.

The glitch sounds, which inherently suggest error or disruption, resonate with the way society perceives and treats non-normative bodies and identities. For disabled trans individuals, their existence often challenges societal norms around ability and gender conformity, leading to a sense of erasure or being "drowned out" by dominant narratives that fail to center or even accommodate their voices. In this context, the vocal suppression becomes symbolic of how their stories and needs are often overshadowed by the louder, more mainstream concerns of able-bodied or cisgender communities.

Moreover, the dissonance created by these industrial and glitch elements can also represent resilience. By incorporating these disruptive sounds into the music, the song challenges listeners to confront discomfort, reflecting the ways in which trans and disabled people resist erasure and assert their existence despite the oppressive "noise." The cacophony, then, becomes a tool for both critique and empowerment, emphasizing the necessity of amplifying these silenced voices.

Furthermore, the lyrics reveal the result of the neglect and nonacceptance from society from the lyrics hinting at self-harm, suicidal ideation, and self-doubt. The music genre (coined Trans Riot Music by free.99 themselves) performs the societal disability of being trans which alarms the listener through the jarring musical choices made by free.99.
