               a helical-type arrangement of the atomic moments. In this
               arrangement the moments within a hexagonal layer are aligned
               parallel and point in a direction perpendicular to the c axis of
               the crystal. The moment direction in adjacent layers is rotated
               by a specific angle which is dependent on the temperature of the
               sample. A slight modification of this structure exists below
               about 140°K, and a transition to ferromagnetism occurs at 87°K.",

               resistivity $\rho$(T) in the range of 77--300 K and the
               temperatures of phase magnetic transformations (Curie
               temperature TC and N{\'e}el temperature TN) of dysprosium was
               studied. It follows from the experimental data and their
               analysis that, within the framework of the indirect exchange
               ideas, the decreases in TC, TN and the contribution to $\rho$(T)
               related to electron scattering in the paramagnetic phase are
               interrelated. It has been suggested that hydrogenation effects
               may be related to changes in microscopic parameters: a decrease
               in the density of states at the Fermi level, an increase in the
               Fermi energy, and a decrease in the effective mass of carriers

               properties of 99.99\% purity copper for Cu-stabilization of
               superconductors has been investigated. Microstructure of copper
               was studied by optical and transmission electron microscopy. The
               chemical composition analysis of impurities has been carried out
               on base of the laser mass-spectrometry data. The electrical
               transport properties have been estimated by residual resistance
               ratio (RRR). It is shown that the difference in RRR values
               obtained for the studied samples are connected to the
               microstructure features, mainly with the surface of grain
               boundaries and concentration of second phases precipitation. The
               experimental correlation of RRR and concentration of
               precipitation (0.01--0.08 vol\%) and oxygen content
               (0.001--0.003 wt.\%) have been obtained. The influence of the
               conduction electron scattering by the different mechanisms on
               the electrical conductivity has been discussed. The comparison
               of measured RRR values and theoretically estimated ones was
